This C++ program presents a user-friendly Simple Calculator, 
offering a seamless experience for performing fundamental arithmetic operations on pairs of input numbers. 
Upon launching the application, users are prompted to input two numerical values and select their preferred operation 
from a menu encompassing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator seamlessly handles both integer and floating-point calculations,
ensuring accurate results with suitable precision. Following each operation, users are empowered to decide
whether to persist with further computations or gracefully exit the program.
